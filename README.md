# Pneumonia-detection-using-Pytorch
I have solved a kaggle dataset of Pneumonia Classification using Pytorch.
First I have used data augmentation and batch normalization techniques to improve the dataset and then I have used resnet 18 model to classify the chest images of having pneumonia or not.
This is the link for the dataset from the kaggle

Using above techniques, I have achieved an accuracy of about 84% on the test dataset.
